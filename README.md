# Igets_sIT
A gets_s implementation for those who lack full C11 Annex K support in their compiler
This C file implements a while loop that will continue to to take input from stdin so long as the input does not match 'n'.  The gets_s function will either return a string of a fixed length or shorter or will return null.
